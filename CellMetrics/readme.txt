(as started by Anton, brian2 codes - summer 2017)
This directory contains the code to generate and explore SFA, PIR and Rheobase current as a function of a,b,d and kLow parameters 
in the Izhikevich cellular model equations, based on strongly adapting CA1 pyramidal cell model developed by Katie (F1000R paper)


(Feb 2018 onward)
Amir used Izhikevich models (as per Katie work) and Anton's codes as starting points to develop cortical inhibitory cell models.
- 2 of them are just brian2 versions of Katie's models: "Katie PV model" and "Katie-f-I curve.."
- the other 3 "L2-3" are specific to the cortical models Amir set up to find appropriate parameters.
